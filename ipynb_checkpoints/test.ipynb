       "[<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Fifty years ago, Toni Servillo wrote a novel. It was praised, won an award, and he came to Rome and got caught up in the party set. He earns a living as an interviewer. Occasionally he is asked why he never wrote another novel, and he offers various, patently untrue reasons. Now his first love, whom he has not seen in more than forty years, has died. He turns thoughtful. He remains amused by the circus of the party set, but shreds their pretensions with a few well chosen words. He is obviously suffering a spiritual crisis, but when he tries to seek advice from a cardinal who is said to be next in line for the Papacy, the man walks away.<br/><br/>The obvious movie to compare this to is Fellini's 8½, but I see its roots in Samuel Pepys' dictum that \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.\" Servillo is not tired of life, but he is tired of this life, and sees death coming for him. He is perfect in the role.<br/><br/>Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino fills the screen with beautifully shot images: the overblown spectacle of the party set trying to amuse themselves, and the quiet beauty of the old Rome, its bridges, the shores, the Colisseum across the street from Servillo's apartment, the remembered image of his first love. It's a rich, beautiful, thoughtful, wistful movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Italian cinema is, at last, on a roll again. Perhaps not in the same way as when Rossellini, Visconti, Fellini and De Sica were batting masterpiece after masterpiece into the arena but maybe more prodigiously than at any time since the young Olmi and young Bertolucci were setting the screen alight. In recent years we have had Michelangelo Frammartino's \"Le Quattro Volte\", Gianni De Gregorio's sublimely gentle comedies \"Mid-August Lunch\" and \"The Salt of Life\" and, perhaps best of all, the films of Paolo Sorrentino whose \"The Consequences of Love\", \"The Family Friend\" and \"Il Divo\" were highly original and sufficiently off-the-wall to invite comparisons with Fellini. His one venture into English-language cinema, \"This Must be the Place\", met with a largely hostile reception from critics who accused him of being self-indulgent but I found the film to be gorgeous and quirky and just what I would have expected from so idiosyncratic a talent. And now we have \"The Great Beauty\", a return to Italy and a return to, what his critics might see as, earlier form.<br/><br/>This film, too, has been compared to Fellini which is entirely appropriate as this is a \"La Dolce Vita\" for the 21st century. You can even imagine the film's central character, Jeb, as Marcello, older if hardly wiser and for Sorrentino nothing much has changed. But if this is Sorrentino in Fellini mode it's just as close to the beauty and spectacle of \"Amarcord\" or, more appropriately, \"Juliet of the Spirits\". Once again the lead is taken by Toni Servillo, who was Sorrentino's Andreotti in \"Il Divo\" and once again he confirms his position as one of the cinema's finest actors, heading a truly superb ensemble cast. <br/><br/>As in \"La Dolce Vita\" there is no real 'story' but rather a series of episodes in the life of Jeb in the days following his 65th birthday, (his birthday party is the first of the film's many great sequences). If there is a theme it's Jeb's increasing disillusionment with the lifestyle he has associated himself with over the years, a lifestyle he is very reluctant to give up, no matter how pragmatically he views it. He is a man who has had many women but no real relationship to speak of, (the early love of his life married someone else). He meets the daughter of an old friend, a 42 year old stripper with a drug habit, and they strike up a relationship of sorts though when they go to bed together he is happy when they don't have sex. He gets sustenance from his friends although he can be cutting and abrasive in their presence. It seems as it is they, and not money or power, which keeps him going.<br/><br/>This is a magnificent movie, the kind of film that you know is being composed, frame by gorgeous frame, by a master film-maker. It is a breathtaking melange of sound and images, of great performances and superlative dialogue that draws you in and holds you from its first shot to its last. Some directors open their films with great tracking shots but Sorrentino saves his to the end, up, over and under the bridges of the Tiber as the final credits roll. Don't leave the cinema to the very last second.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie's title means \"The Big Beauty\", and the story is set in Rome. Of course, the city is prominently featured, so much and so long that it makes you think that \"Rome\" could be probably credited among the actors, at least for a supporting role, as \"herself\". But buyer beware (or, to appropriately use the Latin, Caveat Emptor): this is not a film about the beauty of the immortal city. In a nutshell, I would say that this movie is about the constant research of beauty and meaning in life by an aging intellectual named Jep. I am sure I won't give away too much if I say that, eventually, he will became aware that the beauty in his life is not in Rome – heck, it's not even in the present: poor Jep has been searching for so long in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.<br/><br/>Somebody could be annoyed by the fact that nobody in the movie seems never to do any kind of work at all -- curiously enough, the only self-proclaimed hardworking man happens to be a very seriously-looking international criminal! But for most of the other characters, money looks more like a cause, than a consequence of life. Without the restraints of needs, left with no practical excuses for not being happy, they still accomplish somehow the no small feat of spoiling their lives with various forms of suffering and pain. <br/><br/>The story is wonderfully told both by images and dialogues. It takes some kind of \"magic realism\" turn towards the end – but that's balanced by the steadily cynic tone of the stream of consciousness coming out from Jep, wandering around the city like Marlowe in Los Angeles. Paolo Sorrentino is a writer, too: he has written a couple of enjoyable books starring a character very similar to the one depicted in the movie, a cold bastard bon vivant with a surprisingly soft heart. Mr. Toni Servillo provides flesh, and bone, and looks, and wit for this character. Just another major performance from the greatest Italian living actor: at the end of the movie it leaves into the audience the clear idea to have actually known a real person, not just a fictional one. The whole supporting cast is great, and very well-picked. A special mention goes to Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, two very famous actors in Italy, shining here in two supporting roles where both of them display their undisputed talent.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of the most visually remarkable films I've ever seen. It captures the spirit and beauty of Rome. The camera delves into corners and crevices of the night life and the daytime of this eternal city. This is the story of a man who has debauched his way through life. At sixty-five, he begins to wonder what happened. He is highly respected for his single book (he never wrote another) and has casual friends who are more users than true companions. He hearkens back to a relationship he had earlier, where a woman he could have had, instead ends up with a close friend, who, it turns out, never made her happy. The actions of the characters are vacuous and relatively feckless. He encounters artists who are mostly show and little substance. We see self-indulgent women wasting their lives. This is certainly more about the journey than the result. The people who are most solid in this man's life are the one's he takes for granted. Death seems to be around the corner and what do we do until that happens? Does it make any difference what we do? The beauty here is all around, but is wasted on most of these people.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Russian composer Vladimir Martynov said, \"A man touches the truth twice. The first time is the first cry from a new born baby's lips and the last is the death rattle. Everything between is untruth to a greater or lesser extent.\" Many Hindu and Buddhist teachings also refer to the world as being Maya or illusion. According to French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine, \"Our journey is entirely imaginary. That is its strength. It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative.\" In Paolo Sorrentino's stunning The Great Beauty, novelist Jep Ganbardella (Toni Servillo), unable to write another book since his successful first novel, The Human Apparatus, agrees, saying \"After all... it's just a trick. Yes, it's just a trick.\" To discover that, however, he has to move past \"the chitter-chatter and the noise, silence and sentiment, emotion and fear, the haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty, and then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity, all buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world.\" Winner of the Golden Globe award for Best Foreign Film and Italy's entry for the 2014 Oscars in the same category, The Great Beauty is a character study of the decadent elites of modern Rome and by extension, contemporary society, yet it also moves beyond that to examine eternal themes of death, love, beauty, and the complexity of life and art.<br/><br/>The film begins on a jarring and surreal note and continues in an episodic Fellini-like vein throughout its two and one-half hour runtime - the sweet life revisited. After snapping a picture of the skyline with its beautiful domes and bell towers, a Japanese tourist visiting Janiculum Hill suddenly collapses and dies. We are suddenly shifted to a raucous 65th birthday party for Gambardella on a terrace opposite the Roman Colosseum where seemingly all the socialites, would-be artists, and pseudo-elites have gathered, perhaps the one-percenters of Roman society. One almost expects to see an \"Occupy Via Veneto\" demonstration in the streets below.<br/><br/>As Jep moves in and out and around the Roman high life, Sorrentino's acerbic put-downs and satire of the rich and famous travel with him. Now a journalist for a Vanity-Fair style culture magazine, he watches a performance artist run headlong into a brick wall, sustaining a deep cut on her head, then later interviews her, doggedly asking her to explain what she meant by \"feeling vibrations.\" He waits his turn for a plastic surgeon at a Botox injection session, takes in a performance of a man throwing knives at a frightened-looking woman, observes a live giraffe at a historic site in rehearsal for a magic show, looks at a photographer's self-portraits that span his entire lifetime, and sees a 12-year-old girl heaving different colored cans of paint at a wall canvas while crying and screaming.<br/><br/>Through all the partying, the hedonism, and the ersatz art shows, there exists a stream of discernible emptiness that runs not only through his own life, but through the lives of those he surrounds himself with. After calling out a woman's pretensions, he softens the blow by telling her, \"We're all on the brink of despair. All we can do is look each other in the face, keep each other company, joke a little. Don't you agree?\" His relationship with Ramona (Sabrina Ferilli), the daughter of his good friend, the struggling playwright Romano (Carlo Verdone), however, brings a new focus to his life but it is short-lived.<br/><br/>It is only when he hears of the death of Eliza, a girl he loved as a teenager, that he receives a wake-up call. Reliving his missed opportunity in flashbacks, he learns through her diary that she loved him all along and begins to reexamine the direction of his life. After a less than enlightening meeting with an aging cardinal (Roberto Herlitzka) who wants to talk only about his favorite recipes, he throws a dinner party for a 104-year-old woman rumored to be destined for sainthood who has spent her life working with the poor in Africa and who subsists on 40 grams of plant roots. Seeing life in all of its simplicity and wonder, she movingly points him in the direction of the authentic \"great beauty\" that he seeks.<br/><br/>Servillo is magnificent as the blocked writer seeking renewal and his presence makes every scene come alive with spontaneity. Adding to this is the gorgeous soundtrack featuring The Beatitudes of Martynov, choral works by David Lang, John Taverner, and Arvo Part, and the contemporary Yolanda Be Cool's We No Speak Americano. Though The Great Beauty is not a film about Rome per se, the cinematography of Luca Bigazza memorably captures the striking sights and sounds of The Eternal City, the ancient monuments juxtaposed with the modern buildings. Literally bursting with the pulse of flawed humanity, The Great Beauty is a feast for the eyes, the ears, and the soul.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings again from the darkness. This is Italy's submission to the Academy for Best Foreign Film of 2013. If it wasn't such a beautiful film to watch, a fun game of spot the Italian director influence could be played. Director Paolo Sorrentino owes much to Fellini and La dolce vita, but this is more than a tribute. Sorrentino shows much style and insight, and his commitment to camera angles, movement, colors, textures and faces are quite something to behold.<br/><br/>Toni Servillo plays Jep Gambardella, a man celebrating his 65th birthday by doing what he does most every night ... partying with his group of intellectual friends. Jep had a successful novel published in his 20's and has since worked sporadically as a journalist, but has never again focused on his writing. One can't help but notice the similarities to Marcello Mastroianni in La dolce vita, but Jep is jolted with news that sends him flashing back to his younger years and his one true love.<br/><br/>Much of the story includes Roman decadence, and it can easily be viewed as the decline of Roman civilization both past and present. See, Jep's apartment overlooks the famous ruins of The Colosseum. Even moreso, we get a nice conflict between uppity society and the all too important modern and conceptual art crowd. Toss in a few pot shots at the Vatican and Sorrentino seems to be telling us that everyone takes themselves entirely too seriously ... even as we belittle and judge others. Whatever his true message, the sensory overload provided here could be a film class in camera style and is quite fun to watch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This lengthy (142mins) intriguing, complex movie follows the reflections of former novelist, Jem Gambardella (Toni Servillo), as he contemplates his past and current life, a life, it would appear, of lost opportunities both personal and professional. <br/><br/>As a member of the wealthy elite of Roman society, he participates in their empty pastimes; parties fuelled with drink and drugs, bizarre art events and casual sexual encounters with beautiful but soulless women. Gambardella is both participant and observer, watching himself as much as his associates, mysterious animals trapped in the gilded cage that is Rome with all the stunning beauty of its architecture, fountains, sculptures, and paintings. <br/><br/>We are shown a funeral where Gambradella acts out the etiquette he has just been describing to us; a dinner with a cardinal who seems more interested in food than faith; a saintly nun of extreme age mounting a stone staircase on her knees and crawling painfully onwards and upwards towards an image of Christ . . . Everywhere, life presents contradictions, material and spiritual, emotional pretence and genuine feeling, the Eternal City and its mortal inhabitants, . . .<br/><br/>If all this sounds too heavy, everything is carried along by a welter of gorgeous images complemented by music that varies from the ethereal to hefty thumping dance beats. And the actors' performances are never less than utterly convincing.<br/><br/>At one of the parties as the massed participants enter into yet another conga-style dance, Gambardella remarks that 'we have the best trains in Rome because they don't go anywhere.' Everything comes back to where it starts and ends where it began. So in the long final credits sequence we float languidly beneath the bridges of Rome, left to contemplate the setting in which we first encountered the genial but disillusioned Gambardella. <br/><br/>This is an sumptuous, sensuous, fascinating movie which for me at least probably needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate. Don't miss it!<br/><br/>(Viewed at Screen 1, The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK, 12 September 2013)</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film is a modern masterpiece of Cinema. Luca Bigazzi's cinematography is beautiful, with elegant tracking shots of Rome that draw the viewer into the loveliness of Jep's world (even if age and experience seems to have robbed him of the ability to feel and see this great beauty himself). <br/><br/>The enchanting score of choral works by David Lang (I Lie), Vladimir Martynov (The Beatitudes), John Tavener (The Lamb) and Arvo Part (My Heart is in the Highlands) give depth to the wonderful images of Rome. This haunting soundtrack replaces the need for dialogue and adds intensity to Servillo's melancholic performance.<br/><br/>Servillo's acting is superb from his moments of dry humour to the heartbreaking intensity of those feelings he cannot quite hold on to. <br/><br/>La Grande Bellezza gives a window into Roman life that is probably only fully understood by a fellow Roman. However all can appreciate the aesthetic pleasure of Sorrentino's Rome and the bittersweet meanderings of its characters. <br/><br/>This is a cinema of the highest order, imbued with elegance &amp; style. For the viewer it is like swimming in honey. Grazie Signore Sorrentino.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had to go to see this movie twice in a row as the first time was not enough: I was literally overwhelmed by it like the Japanese tourist at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is about Rome, about true love, about decadence, about difficulty of communicating, about values.<br/><br/>But the most important subject is life itself and how to live without having regrets.<br/><br/>Many word have been spent about Sorrentino talent, so I am not going to talk about it: he is without doubts one of the most talented directors alive (and surely the best Italian).<br/><br/>The great beauty is well written, dialogues are intelligent and philosophic, really good food for thoughts.<br/><br/>The character are perfectly described and very, very well played (Toni Servillo is not a surprise because we knew him from The consequences of love and Il divo), but other actors like Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, they have been a nice discover indeed.<br/><br/>You will leave the theatre with the awareness you have seen a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Highly recommended</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Deep and elegant mental decadence in nowadays Rome. I did love so much this film, it reminds me some old classic Italian movies. Watching the movie I thought about Marcello Mastroianni, it could have been the perfect actor for this film if this was his movies era. But do not misunderstand me, Toni Servillo is in my opinion the best actor for this movie. Locations are decadent and superb. What I liked so much about this movie is also the rhythm, the pauses and all the surrounding characters that give sense to the whole decadent plot. When the movie ended, I and other people stood up and watched the screen silently. This is a movie that lasts in your mind for a long time. As sadness and emptiness are perfectly mixed in the main character with poetry and sincere joie di vivre, all surrounded with astonishing and unusual views of Rome.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Whilst not quite so beguiled as the other viewers who have commented here I did find much to admire yet this admiration was tempered by the constant compulsion to relate The Grand Beauty to previous movies, principally those of Fellini - the several 'grotesques' in the cast; the aimlessness of the central character; the episodic rather than straight-ahead storyline - so that I was constantly saying to myself, where are we now, Amarcord?, La Dolce Vita? Toni Servillo's Rome is at once real and surreal and he wanders through it as if, at one moment he is not Jason himself but a minor Argomaut content to pursue a silver fleece, and at the next a watered-down Orpheus following Eurydice above, instead of below ground. Extremely lyrical in spots, extremely blah in spots. Sue me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The analogy presented several times in this film is that Proust wanted to write a book about nothing. That is also what the director of this film has done, and what the main character has done with his own life. This is a film about nothing, but of course still about something – the main character Jep. The film is simply just about this character and how he spends his time. <br/><br/>Jep has self-reflection, he's honest, doesn't take things so seriously, and he doesn't try to convince himself that he's something that he's not. Although one of his snobbish, bitter and self-righteous acquaintances annoys him, he doesn't let it bother him too much, and he doesn't say anything about it until she asks him to. He lives a happy, carefree life and is not consumed with worries. Unlike the most of us who \"spends the summer making plans for September\" as one of the characters say, Jep \"looks for the great beauty\" by living in the present an enjoying everything beautiful around him – paintings, food, birds, churches, trees, the ocean, etc. He finds joy in this moment and not in the future. It is actually quite inspiring to watch. But there is nevertheless something missing. Life basically has two missions: Accomplish your dream (whether through work or through raising a family) and find companionship (whether with a partner or with friends), and while Jep has certainly enjoyed his time in Rome, he hasn't achieved any of those two goals. Sex with someone new is not something beautiful shared with another person for him, but simply an everyday thing that's part of his lifestyle. I found this to be one of the key themes in the film. Jep tries to find \"the great beauty\" in life but hasn't found the greatest one of them all: love. He has gone through life partying, shagging, smoking and enjoying, but has never found the woman he loves, nor had any children.<br/><br/>All of these characters are trying to find a place where they belong, but none of them are really successful. Most of them want to be accepted by the right crowd or the right woman, but fails in a hierarchy where you can never reach the top. As the movie progresses, more and more people leave Rome as they haven't found the great beauty of love either. One doesn't even want to bring his furniture but just leaves everything behind. Apparently, he hasn't accomplished or accumulated anything there that he would want to remember. So, it's also a critique of modern day Rome and all its citizens' love of being hip. It's elegantly done, and especially the dialogue is beautiful, poetic and well-written.<br/><br/>Another reference to literature I found was that the main character and some of the other characters remind me of the three main characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (the character in this film who wants to stage a play would be Basil Hallward).<br/><br/>The biggest drawback of this film is its length. A film about nothing that lasts almost two-and-a-half hours is simply too long. Had it been 30 or 45 minutes shorter it would have been a more pleasant view. The film starts out as a beautiful feel-good film, but ends up as a sad tragedy – with some hope though. It's never too late to make a change.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Great Beauty is such an unusual concoction of sights and sounds, it's a wonder it works at all. Watching it is like seeing a walking bicycle and realizing, to your amazement, that one can actually ride it.<br/><br/>The movie follows Jep Gambardella, the king of Rome's night life. Jep came to Rome in his twenties, after having written a very promising novel, but 40 years later he is settled as a journalist for a high-class literary magazine. Jep has friends, who are just as frustrated and unsatisfied with their lives as he is, despite having all their red Ferraris and high-rise condos. Together they keep each other company and form a support group of sorts. The presence of other miserable people convinces them it's OK, the life is still worth living and facade is still worth maintaining.<br/><br/>Jep has invested last four decades into becoming the Rome's chief socialite and now he has the power to make party a success or disaster. But there's something compulsive about his pursuit of entertainment and admiration. Like a functioning alcoholic, Jep doesn't enjoy his life, but has no will to change it either. He reminds me of Michael Fassbender's sex-addict character in Shame. At the time of orgasm, Fassbender's expression was not that of pleasure, but of pain.<br/><br/>Soon after his 65th birthday, Jep notes to himself that he no longer can afford doing things he doesn't want to do. Instead, he looks up his old friends, learns more about his now-dead girlfriend who left him 40 years ago and develops a friendship with 41 year old stripper named Ramona. Ramona doesn't try to appear important or intellectual, she seems to exist entirely in the present moment. (That presence of mind has its own price, as we learn later)<br/><br/>One of the appealing things about Great Beauty is that its characters are not aware of how funny they are. The pinnacle of comical absurdity is a 104 year old Catholic 'saint'. She's not official saint yet, we're told, but everyone calls her Santa (Saint) Maria. She looks like a mummy that just walked out of its glass case in British Museum, communicates with animals and at one point parodies the 'stair crawl' from the Exorcist. And yet, at no point the film is making fun of her. Nobody seems to question their sanity when Santa Maria asks a flock of migrating flamingos to rest on Jep's balcony.<br/><br/>Sometimes I think the Great Beauty is making it intentionally difficult for us to get to the story. The opening scene with Jep's euro-trash birthday party lasts several minutes longer than storytelling rules require. The changes between scenes are often abrupt and even stunning, leaving the viewer to fill the gaps. There's no obvious drama or big emotional payoff, as you'd expect from an American movie. And yet, at its core, it's the same old story about a writer who has lost his inspiration and tries to figure his place in the world. I feel sympathy for him and his journey, just like I would in any other film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It must have been a film full of meanings, but I didn't understand the half of it, I found it monotonous and boring, long and meaningless, good photography, confusing script, bizarre and strange characters, melancholy protagonist. It's one of those films that requires extraordinary depth and sensitivity to be able to understand the fullness of the lines, speeches, actions and opinions... I'm still short... \"The Hunt\" didn't deserve to lose the Oscar for this one...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">«La grande bellezza» is a catalogue of ideas, keys and open secrets for all ages, although I am almost sure that being coetaneous to the leading character Jep Gambardella, is some sort of privilege that allow us to enjoy this motion picture more. I have talked about it with a 27-year old good friend and scriptwriting colleague. We share the same opinion, that it is a beautiful, wise and distending work; as writers, we agree that it is rich, varied, complex and simultaneously transparent. Nevertheless I must add that for me, a man who is as old as Jep, the film turned into an illuminating, multifaceted experience, that told me many thing about the geographical determinism that many persons reject, it spoke to me about Roma-the city and Roma-the empire, and it told me many things about myself. I know that people from a given place bring their laughter, stride and shadow along, and they also bring the story of their city: as I saw the scene in which Stefano, the holder of keys, opens the doors of halls and rooms filled with beauty, history and art, not only did I think of Federico Fellini's «Roma», but of Roman persons I have known, and I thought all at once, \"They all bring this cultural load behind their backs, maybe unknowingly\"\n",
       "  Maybe that is why the simple assertion made by the old nun known as a Saint, has other resonance: \"Roots are important\", says she, referring to the roots she eats, but also to roots that define us. The film opens with a noisy and frivolous Roma, that evokes (also in other scenes) «La dolce vita», also by Fellini. But this apparently perpetual party becomes no longer a common place, but rather a distinctive feature without which I, we cannot imagine Roma. The idea of Roma-the empire has also had a strange fascination on me. Of the little that I have learnt in History courses, I hardly remember a cultural and geographical domain that had a bigger impact on me that the Roman empire. Not even the present-day American version of an empire, which I do not perceive in books but in direct, can strike me, with its daily boasting that our lives hang from their atomic fits of dominance. Roma-the empire strikes me as something great, cruel, impressive, wise, mad and vulgar too, in its beauty and exuberance. Finally I truly believe that, for a good part of my life, I was blatantly mundane as Jep Gambardella defines himself (in an extraordinary performance by Toni Servillo), as Jep is described on screen, and as we imagine how he should had been in his younger years, climbing and descending peaks of concupiscence, militancy, apprenticeship and pain. Each character –the moving stripper Ramona, the unloved playwright Romano, the dogmatic Stefania, the ideal boss and dwarf Dadina\n",
       " - is a friend or someone we met on the road of life, each is one of our facets, an option yet to discover or dig deeply. In their script, Paolo Sorrentino (at 43) and Umberto Contarello (at 55) reproduce that sudden awareness of everything around us that comes to many with old age, that feeling of futility as we face past actions, that foolish and impertinent judgment we make of the meaning of life, as we see us in old age and find every action without any projective dimension, as something flat and despicable. Jep and his friends may also think of frustration, but it is a frustration determined by the dichotomy \"winners versus losers\", according to a system of values invented by a moronic TV host. Or hostess. I think that the greatest value of «La grande bellezza» is that it triggers (in the enlightened young or in the alert old) a flow of thoughts, sensations and emotions about this early 21st century, in which we are arguing if it is an aftermath or a prologue\n",
       "  We live it and sense that we are contributing to (or alienating from) the evolution to another order of things, at least minimally fairer than previous. Maybe this film can be used (if it were necessary to do so) to let us all know that our passage through the biosphere is not futile, even if we find no sense to it. Maybe this is \"la grande bellezza\", the real great beauty of life, and not the chimera that Jep Gambardella is after, to find inspiration and tell the world the story of \"the king of the mundane\".</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">For me, this film goes to the absolute limits of what can be achieved in a film. Each shot, each scene is a thing of great beauty. The plot is secondary. It was a delight to watch. I might admit a bias: I am an Italophile. And this film has all things Italian: style, of course, but more than that it's the attitude that no matter how they look, they're confident in themselves. There were lots of ironic moments in the film as well: almost as if it were the Italians mocking themselves. Film centers around a main character, and Toni Sevillo is perfect. His character is memorable: he stands out like a character in a great novel. All the other actors, almost stock characters are perfect too. The film's got some ideas too: ideas about art, and life, and transcendence, but somehow one doesn't pay much attention to these too, given all this beauty.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I see nearly every art film that comes to town. This is just my opinion, but I think The Great Beauty was one of the worst of 2013. It's almost all spectacle and almost no substance. There is no story to speak of and little character development; just two hours and twenty minutes of mostly unrelated scenes showing the decadence of Rome's affluent. The movie reveals less of the city itself than you might think based on the reviews. And many of the scenes are at night, limiting what you can see. <br/><br/>Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), the main character, is one of the few people in the film who are halfway likable. Most of the other characters are types whom you would be happy never to meet in real life. Servillo has a very expressive face, and I'm sure he would be interesting to watch in a better movie. But here he is forced to wander aimlessly through scene after vacuous scene. Supposedly, Jep is taking stock of his life now that he's reached his 65th birthday. You keep expecting him to have some kind of epiphany, but there is little evidence of it on the screen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can't say I dislike this film. It has some seriously wonderful scenes, some truly exquisitely photographed and performed scenes, scenes that truly transcend into something quite beautiful. But this is only 20% of the film, or so. The rest is meandering and while I'm usually all in favor for films like this, ambiguous to a fault, I usually feel something, some spark of emotion that's on the screen. With this, nothing. As it is, I can't say it's totally a good film, but I also can't quite dismiss it. Maybe it's something that needs a rewatch, but I don't see myself having the excitement to actually rewatch it, not even for the amazing cinematography.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After all is said and done, what are we actually longing for? The movie will not give you an individual answer obviously, but it you might still be able to take something from this. Only if you are in the right frame of mind of course. Because this is not just about age, but life in general. And while it might not seem to actually trying to tell you something, it does.<br/><br/>And that is the beauty of it. You also should consider that the nudity is not really there to agitate or arouse. The main character might be able to tell people some things that are too honest (and for that fact you'll either love him or hate him), but he's the one stirring things up. Be it on purpose or by just being himself. There comes a time when you might be past a few things ... that time came for our \"hero\" here ... a special kind of drama</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ethereal fountains, dancing in the streets, and siren songs in the ancient beauty of Rome.<br/><br/>Jep wanders the streets of the primeval city at all hours visiting with friends, attending swanky parties, witnessing a funeral, pondering life, pursuing women and, welcome or not, dispensing advice. Witty conversations and intriguing allusions abound in this irreverent and cerebral journey through the piazzas of Rome as well as the self.<br/><br/>Toni Servillo, the star of the impressive, intricate and unique political film Il Divo, deftly becomes Jep. Even digital captioning is not able to keep up with the Italian wit, barbs and words that flow and gurgle like the fast flowing fountains that are all over the city. I wish I was fluent in the language in order to capture more of the meanings and innuendos. Beyond the words there is depth in gazes, gestures and fashionable clothes, and - of course - the deep history and art of Rome. So much to fathom here. Seen at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Have I seen the same movie as the other reviewers? I've REALLY tried to stay to the end of this movie to see if I things would get better but I just couldn't suffer any longer. The director clearly tried to copy some of Fellini's imaginative creations instead of his own. This was not even a homage to the great Italian director. Shame Oscar Academy to award this movie as the best foreign film of 2013. If you don't agree with me just watch \"The Hunt\" or \"The Broken Circle Breakdown\". How about \"The Attack\", \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\",the documentary \"The Act of Killing\", \"No\",\"A Touch of Sin\", \"Like Someone in Love\", \"Blancanieves\", \"The Attack\" and the list go on and on</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>\"La grande bellezza\" (2013) is without a doubt the best movie Paolo Sorrentino has made yet. Not only this is his best film to date, this is a one great movie on every account. I was captivated by it from the first frame, which opens on a pretty long party sequence till the very last frame. Yet, this movie isn't for everyone. Those who like clear and plot based movie might find this gem to difficult and even boring. Nevertheless, this is one of the very best Italian movies i have ever seen. Every scene in this movie is done very skilfully and it's just interesting to watch and to listen to characters, especially to our hero Jep Gambardella (superbly played by Toni Servillo), a \"party lion\", who at 65 starts to have some thought about life and starts to find and see beauty in everything, even the most bizarre things. <br/><br/>Overall, \"La grande bellezza\" (or \"The Great Beauty\") was a huge surprise to me. Saw it first time just now, i would like to recommend this near masterpiece to everyone who liked great movie simply about life - it's not about plot, it's about moments here and now, the people, culture, even nightlife of some Bohemia of Rome. Great movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Jep Gambardella once wrote an award winning novella. He is now an aged socialite writer. After his lavish 65th birthday party, he starts to reflect on his life and taking stock of his future. He meets various people in his life. He wonders if he should write another novel. A friend asks him to find a husband for his 40 year old stripper daughter Romona.<br/><br/>This is no doubt that this is beautifully shot. The characters live in such a pretentious world that it comes off somewhat surreal. At some point, I rather not spend any more time with these people. These people are cold and eat at my nerves. There is one good laugh early on. That young girl who is forced to paint for her parents is the most compelling scene. It says so much that there are so few kids in the movie and she doesn't even want to be in their world. This is an old, tired and pretentious Rome. That may be the point but it's not fun to watch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the life that we have the chance to live, after all the pain that we've been through, we always realize that in the past there was a time that we were happy, because back then we would see the present and the future as one. Whereas, when we feel like we've grown, the future and the present does not seem the same to us at all. So we feel an unconscious suffering that correlates to our growth as a person.<br/><br/>Most of the times, life will feel meaningless. It will give us many reasons to think so, and we will always be ready to question it. But through this weight, we somehow always give dignity to the life that we are living. The great beauty that we look for is hidden inside this dilemma. It will never be clear to us and that is why it's beautiful.<br/><br/>The Great Beauty is not just a movie; it's essentially an endless book that even if you'd keep reading it for the rest of your life, you'd still find something to feel for, rather than learn from. It tells us that even though we let the time slip away from our hands and then feel sorry and guilty about it, we will power through no matter what.<br/><br/>As in Jep Gambardilla's words, \"Beyond there is what lies beyond. I don't deal with what lies beyond. Therefore, let this novel begin. After all, it's just a trick.\"<br/><br/>Life is what we make it out to be and it also ends in a certain way that we're sure of. But trying to think where that way goes is pointless as the greatest beauty of our lives is behind this mystery. So, let us live the life however we want. After all, it will always end in the same way.</div>]"

Watching the movie I thought about Marcello Mastroianni, it could have been the perfect actor for this film if this was his movies era. But do not misunderstand me, Toni Servillo is in my opinion the best actor for this movie. Locations are decadent and superb. What I liked so much about this movie is also the rhythm, the pauses and all the surrounding characters that give sense to the whole decadent plot. When the movie ended, I and other people stood up and watched the screen silently. This is a movie that lasts in your mind for a long time.

       " \"Whilst not quite so beguiled as the other viewers who have commented here I did find much to admire yet this admiration was tempered by the constant compulsion to relate The Grand Beauty to previous movies, principally those of Fellini - the several 'grotesques' in the cast; the aimlessness of the central character; the episodic rather than straight-ahead storyline - so that I was constantly saying to myself, where are we now, Amarcord?, La Dolce Vita? Toni Servillo's Rome is at once real and surreal and he wanders through it as if, at one moment he is not Jason himself but a minor Argomaut content to pursue a silver fleece, and at the next a watered-down Orpheus following Eurydice above, instead of below ground. Extremely lyrical in spots, extremely blah in spots. Sue me.\",\n",

       " '«La grande bellezza» is a catalogue of ideas, keys and open secrets for all ages, although I am almost sure that being coetaneous to the leading character Jep Gambardella, is some sort of privilege that allow us to enjoy this motion picture more. I have talked about it with a 27-year old good friend and scriptwriting colleague. We share the same opinion, that it is a beautiful, wise and distending work; as writers, we agree that it is rich, varied, complex and simultaneously transparent. Nevertheless I must add that for me, a man who is as old as Jep, the film turned into an illuminating, multifaceted experience, that told me many thing about the geographical determinism that many persons reject, it spoke to me about Roma-the city and Roma-the empire, and it told me many things about myself. I know that people from a given place bring their laughter, stride and shadow along, and they also bring the story of their city: as I saw the scene in which Stefano, the holder of keys, opens the doors of halls and rooms filled with beauty, history and art, not only did I think of Federico Fellini\\'s «Roma», but of Roman persons I have known, and I thought all at once, \"They all bring this cultural load behind their backs, maybe unknowingly\"\\x85 Maybe that is why the simple assertion made by the old nun known as a Saint, has other resonance: \"Roots are important\", says she, referring to the roots she eats, but also to roots that define us. The film opens with a noisy and frivolous Roma, that evokes (also in other scenes) «La dolce vita», also by Fellini. But this apparently perpetual party becomes no longer a common place, but rather a distinctive feature without which I, we cannot imagine Roma. The idea of Roma-the empire has also had a strange fascination on me. Of the little that I have learnt in History courses, I hardly remember a cultural and geographical domain that had a bigger impact on me that the Roman empire. Not even the present-day American version of an empire, which I do not perceive in books but in direct, can strike me, with its daily boasting that our lives hang from their atomic fits of dominance.
